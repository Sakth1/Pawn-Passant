# Pawn-Passant
A chess application to play (computer and others) , learn and analyse game even at times without connecting to internet.


This is an application written in python to play and learn chess. The objective is to make chess accessable offline to play against chess engines to learn and analyse the game. Here are the goals:
- play games against computer at different difficulty
- ability to analyse any game
- ability to learn openings offline
- ability to play locally with others
- intutive gui
- ability to play online

Week 1: Setup & Planning
- Learn basics of project structure and Git.
- Choose GUI library (recommended: PyQt5 or Tkinter).
- Create folder structure and initialize GitHub repo.
- Install python-chess and test a basic board with legal moves.

Week 2: Learn & Implement Chess Logic
- Practice using python-chess: board setup, move validation.
- Build a terminal version of the game (text-based).
- Implement move input, turns, and game-over conditions.


Week 3: Learn GUI Basics
- Learn PyQt5 basics (widgets, layout, events) or Tkinter if you prefer.
- Start GUI layout: empty board with squares and coordinate labels.
- Load piece images and place them on the board.


Week 4: Build a Click-to-Move GUI
- Enable click-to-select and move pieces on the board.
- Integrate python-chess logic with GUI.
- Show current player turn and legal move highlights.



‚ôüÔ∏è Month 2: Game Modes & AI Integration
Goal: Add play modes ‚Äì player vs player and vs computer (Stockfish).
Week 5: Local Multiplayer Mode
- Complete hotseat play (2 players on same device).

- Display engine‚Äôs move and evaluation.


Week 8: Polish and Test
- Add undo button and simple move timer.

Week 12: Review and Polish
- Fix bugs and refine UI.
- Make buttons/icons intuitive.
- Backup everything to GitHub.



üåê Month 4: Online Play & Finishing Touches
Goal: Try basic online play and wrap up project.
Week 13: Learn Sockets (for Online Play)
- Learn Python socket basics.
- Create a simple two-player connection test (terminal first).


Week 14: Online Chess Prototype
- Allow remote players to connect and play.
- Sync moves and turns across devices (basic LAN or IP-based).


Week 15: Polish GUI & Add Settings
- Add themes (e.g., dark mode).
- Add settings page: difficulty, time, player name, etc.
- Add sound effects (optional).


Week 16: Final Touches & Packaging
- Final test: all features working (PvP, AI, Analysis, Online).
